 Syntax Colouring

  Syntax colouring enhances readability of documents.
  Colouring informations are stored in the [config\ext] directory,
  using TOP format files. Example of file with colouring information is the
  [config\ext\assembly.utf8]

  Such files ending in ".utf8" may be considered "class" files.
  In the [config\ext] directory you can find several other 0-byte
  files that refers each of them to their class file.

  They show the class in the 2nd part of their filename.
  These are "extension" files, example.: "inc.assembly"
  "asm.assembly","equ.assembly"
 
  Note: For the nature of Unicode and languages we dont know
  a fast and efficient method to distinguish UPPERCASE letters from
  lovercases. For this reason, having the extension file
  "asm.assembly" all files ending in ".asm" will be opened
  correctly. On the contrary no syntax coluriing apply to those having ".Asm" 
  as extension. To allow Syntax Colouring on those ".Asm", create a 0-byte file
  in the [config\ext] directory and name it as
  "Asm.assembly".

  The class file (ex.:"assembly.utf8") is a script file of commands for the 
  Scintilla component. Implemented commands are:
  
  lexer      set a lexer for a type of file.
             a list of all lexers is in the [shared\scintilla.inc]
             of the source package of x64lab
             Note: not all lexers are included in the final build
             of Scintilla component.
